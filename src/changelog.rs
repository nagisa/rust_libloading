//! Project changelog

/// Release 0.3.0 (Date TBA)
///
/// * Greatly improved documentation, especially around platform-specific behaviours;
/// * Improved test suite by building our own library to test against;
/// * Added `impl From<os::platform::Library> for Library` and `impl From<Library> for
/// os::platform::Library` allowing wrapping and extracting the platform-specific library handle;
/// * Added methods to wrap (`Symbol::from_raw`) and unwrap (`Symbol::into_raw`) the safe `Symbol`
/// wrapper into unsafe `os::platform::Symbol`.
///
/// The last two additions focus on not restricting potential usecases of this library, allowing
/// users of the library to circumvent safety checks if need be.
///
/// ## Beaking Changes
///
/// `Library::new` defaults to `RTLD_NOW` instead of `RTLD_LAZY` on UNIX for more consistent
/// cross-platform behaviour. If a library loaded with `Library::new` had any linking errors, but
/// unresolved references weren’t forced to be resolved, the library would’ve “just worked”,
/// whereas now the call to `Library::new` will return an error signifying presence of such error.
///
/// ## os::platform
/// * Added `os::unix::Library::open` which allows specifying arbitrary flags (e.g. `RTLD_LAZY`);
/// * Added `os::windows::Library::get_ordinal` which allows finding a function or variable by its
/// ordinal number;
